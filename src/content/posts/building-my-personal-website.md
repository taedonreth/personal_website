# The Vision

Creating a personal website was always something I wanted to do, but I kept putting it off. I wanted it to be more than just a resume - I wanted it to showcase my personality, interests, and the journey I'm on as a developer.

## Design Philosophy

I decided early on that I wanted this website to feel like a video game interface. Growing up playing games, I always loved the aesthetic of RPGs and adventure games. The pixelated fonts, glowing buttons, and achievement-style cards felt like the perfect way to represent my journey as a developer.

Key design decisions included:

- Using VT323 for headers to give that retro gaming feel
- Implementing a card-based layout for projects and experiences
- Adding rarity levels to projects (like in games)
- Including sound effects for interactions
- Using a dark theme with accent colors

## Technical Stack

For the technical implementation, I chose Next.js with TypeScript. This combination provides:

- Excellent developer experience
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- Easy deployment with Vercel

I also used Tailwind CSS for styling, which made it easy to create the pixelated, game-like aesthetic I was going for. Framer Motion added smooth animations that enhanced the user experience.

## Content Strategy

I structured the website around several key sections:

- **Experience:** Professional journey and achievements
- **Projects:** Technical projects with detailed descriptions
- **Interests:** Personal hobbies and passions
- **Newsletter:** Thoughts and reflections on my journey

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest challenges was creating a cohesive design system that felt both professional and playful. I solved this by:

- Creating reusable components for cards, buttons, and text
- Establishing a consistent color palette
- Using consistent spacing and typography scales

## Future Plans

This website is a living project that I plan to continue evolving. Future improvements include:

- Adding a blog section with more detailed posts
- Implementing a contact form
- Adding more interactive elements
- Creating a portfolio gallery

## Lessons Learned

Building this website taught me a lot about:

- Balancing creativity with usability
- The importance of consistent design systems
- How to effectively showcase technical skills
- The value of personal branding

Most importantly, it reminded me why I love web development - the ability to create something that's both functional and expressive, technical and creative.
